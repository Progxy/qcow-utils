# QCow Utils

This repo contains utilities for parsing and generally working with QCow images.

## Development Notes

For now we still do not support all the features of QCow files, neither taking into account possible interoperability.
Mostly because there isn't a real standard, and furthermore this implementation have been completed for another project.

-- Here put the table of supported features --

## Use and Installation

Just clone the repo (maybe using `--depth=1` for a shallow copy), and then simply include the `qcow_parser.h` header in your application.
NOTE: at the moment we do not offer a make target to compile it into a dynamic/static library, but there will probably be.

Once included just call the exposed functions: `qread` and `qwrite` to perform reading and writing operations.

### Note
The utility has been tested with the [Arch Linux](https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/images/latest/Arch-Linux-x86_64-basic.qcow2) base qcow
